Using RRI

It uses stringstreams to store the imputdata for read_xml and for write_xml

Robotstudio -> c++ server 	works
c++ server -> Robotstudio 	works at 10ms -> 100Hz rate 
				doesn't work at 8ms -> 125Hz rate
				this version can be improved by not using the xml files to store data or to create the sending message
