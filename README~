Using RRI

Robotstudio -> c++ server 	works
c++ server -> Robotstudio 	produces a communication error after (MaxLost+2) number of messages,  
				despite the fact that robotstudio seems to take the data from the xml
				messages sent ( checked by using the flexpendant). 
				Same problem, I made host_info_list to point to host_info struct, as the post C++ Server Connection Issue suggests, but I have the same behavior
				I tried also building my one struct as the post suggests and I get the same behavior
